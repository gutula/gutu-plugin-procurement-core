Source-to-procure commitments including requisitions, sourcing outcomes, purchase orders, receipt expectations, and supplier exception management.

## Part Of The Gutu Stack

| Aspect | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repo kind | First-party plugin |
| Domain group | Operational Data |
| Default category | Business / Procurement & Sourcing |
| Primary focus | requisitions, purchase commitments, receipt expectations |
| Best when | You need a governed domain boundary with explicit contracts and independent release cadence. |
| Composes through | Actions+Resources+Jobs+Workflows+UI |

- Gutu keeps plugins as independent repos with manifest-governed boundaries, compatibility channels, and verification lanes instead of hiding everything behind one giant mutable codebase.
- This plugin is meant to compose through explicit actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and runtime envelopes, not through undocumented hook chains.

## What It Does Now

Owns requisitions, sourcing outcomes, purchase commitments, and receipt expectations while leaving stock and finance truth to their owning plugins.

- Exports 3 governed actions: `procurement.requisitions.create`, `procurement.purchase-orders.issue`, `procurement.receipts.request`.
- Owns 3 resource contracts: `procurement.requisitions`, `procurement.purchase-orders`, `procurement.receipt-requests`.
- Publishes 2 job definitions with explicit queue and retry policy metadata.
- Publishes 1 workflow definition with state-machine descriptions and mandatory steps.
- Adds richer admin workspace contributions on top of the base UI surface.
- Ships explicit SQL migration or rollback helpers alongside the domain model.
- Documents 7 owned entity surface(s): `Purchase Requisition`, `RFQ`, `Supplier Quote`, `Purchase Order`, `Receipt Request`, `Supplier Return`, and more.
- Carries 4 report surface(s) and 4 exception queue(s) for operator parity and reconciliation visibility.
- Tracks ERPNext reference parity against module(s): `Buying`, `Subcontracting`.
- Operational scenario matrix includes `requisition-to-rfq`, `award-to-purchase-order`, `receipt-request-to-bill-suggestion`, `subcontract-procurement`.
- Governs 3 settings or policy surface(s) for operator control and rollout safety.

## Maturity

**Maturity Tier:** `Hardened`

This tier is justified because unit coverage exists, contract coverage exists, integration coverage exists, migration coverage exists, job definitions are exported, and workflow definitions are exported.

## Verified Capability Summary

- Domain group: **Operational Data**
- Default category: **Business / Procurement & Sourcing**
- Verification surface: **Build+Typecheck+Lint+Test+Contracts+Migrations+Integration**
- Tests discovered: **5** total files across unit, contract, integration, migration lanes
- Integration model: **Actions+Resources+Jobs+Workflows+UI**
- Database support: **postgres + sqlite**

## Quick Start For Integrators

Use this repo inside a **compatible Gutu workspace** or the **ecosystem certification workspace** so its `workspace:*` dependencies resolve honestly.

```bash
# from a compatible workspace that already includes this plugin's dependency graph
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run docs:check
```

```ts
import { manifest, createPrimaryRecordAction, BusinessPrimaryResource, jobDefinitions, workflowDefinitions, adminContributions, uiSurface } from "@plugins/procurement-core";

console.log(manifest.id);
console.log(createPrimaryRecordAction.id);
console.log(BusinessPrimaryResource.id);
```

Use the root repo scripts for day-to-day work **after the workspace is bootstrapped**, or run the nested package directly from `framework/builtin-plugins/procurement-core` if you need lower-level control.

## Current Test Coverage

- Root verification scripts: `bun run build`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run test:contracts`, `bun run test:unit`, `bun run test:integration`, `bun run test:migrations`, `bun run docs:check`
- Unit files: 1
- Contracts files: 1
- Integration files: 1
- Migrations files: 2

## Known Boundaries And Non-Goals

- Not a full vertical application suite; this plugin only owns the domain slice exported in this repo.
- Not a replacement for explicit orchestration in jobs/workflows when multi-step automation is required.
- Cross-plugin composition should use Gutu command, event, job, and workflow primitives. This repo should not be documented as exposing a generic WordPress-style hook system unless one is explicitly exported.

## Recommended Next Milestones

- Deepen sourcing, tolerance, and exception handling before more warehouse and financial flows depend on procurement commitments.
- Add stronger scorecard and substitution support where supplier governance becomes critical.
- Broaden lifecycle coverage with deeper orchestration, reconciliation, and operator tooling where the business flow requires it.
- Add more explicit domain events or follow-up job surfaces when downstream systems need tighter coupling.
- Convert more ERP parity references into first-class runtime handlers where needed, starting from `Supplier`, `Request for Quotation`, `Supplier Quotation`.
